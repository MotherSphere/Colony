# Orbital Arcade

This directory contains the standalone Orbital Arcade window. All arcade-specific source code and assets live here so the main launcher remains focused on navigation and system-wide controls.

- `src/` – source files for the Orbital Arcade module.
- `assets/` – graphics, audio, and other resources used by the arcade experience.
- `arcade_main.cpp` entry point lives under `src/orbital_arcade/` and is built as the `orbital_arcade` library.
