# Archive Vault UX Notes

This document captures the visual direction for the Archive Vault program. The objective is to
deliver a premium, animation-rich experience that aligns with the Colony aesthetic while keeping
the UI maintainable and testable.

## Key principles

- **Split-view layout** that scales from laptop to desktop resolutions with a collapsible navigation
  rail and an adaptive detail panel.
- **Micro-interactions everywhere**: animated focus rings, easing on panel transitions, contextual
  tooltips, and responsive status indicators for syncing and security events.
- **Theme aware** components that react to the global color palette generated by the main app while
  exposing Archive-specific accents for highlights and alerts.
- **Accessibility first**: focus order, keyboard shortcuts, reduced-motion fallback, and high-contrast
  palette switching without compromising the visual identity.

## Immediate next steps

1. Establish a `ThemeController` that synchronizes with `utils::Preferences` and exposes
   animation timelines (spring/fade) to the views in `ui/`.
2. Prototype the login/unlock flow using ImGui docking to validate the motion system and toasts.
3. Document reusable UI atoms (badges, cards, CTA buttons) before expanding to feature-specific
   screens like the vault dashboard or entry editor.
